                    The Bishop's School may be said to have as its date of foundation the <b>19th April'1864</b>
                    . On this day the Quarter Master General of the Bombay Army, writing to the Secretary
                    Govt. Military Department, stated.......<br>

                        <p>
                            On May 30th, 1864 the Adjutant General of the Army, Lt. Col. Sydney T. Stock, wrote
                            to the Secretary of Government, Education Department, Bombay, requesting for educational
                            facilities for children of Warrant Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers stationed
                            at Poona who, not belonging to Regiments, did not have regimental facilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scheme for the School was drawn up by the Quartermaster General, Major General
                            Smith CB. The school was to be self-supporting. The original fees per month in respect
                            of each boy was Rs. 5/-. The first School Master received the salary of a third
                            class Army School Master (Rs. 83-3 annas - 10 pies) besides his rations. Corporal
                            Mansfield was the first School Master and the school started with 15 pupils. Rev.
                            Fenton and Lt. Jacob, Acting Superintendent of Army Schools, did a lot of spade
                            work in getting the school started. The school started functioning in one of the
                            Old Barracks, and the Barrack Master provided the basic furniture. Initially the
                            army also sanctioned certain sums of money for defraying the expenses, for the School
                            Master and for maps, globes, books, stationery, registers etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A reference to the formation of the school was also made in the Bombay Gazette dated
                            14th June, 1864. On the 6th August, 1864certain grants were sanctioned, and there
                            was a statement in the Gazette by Sir A. Grant that the school was specially established
                            for the children of Warrant and Non-Commissioned Officers. On 12th September, 1864,
                            the Acting Controller of Military Accountants sanctioned the release of Rs. 500/-
                            for the projected school. Therefore the fact that we are celebrating Founders Week
                            in October is very appropriate, because it was roughly this time in 1864 that the
                            school actually started functioning in the Old Army Barracks somewhere near our
                            present site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The school moved to its present site in 1868 when a certain Khan Bahadur Pudumjee
                            Pestonjee sold the property to the then Lord Bishop of Bombay for a sum of Rs. 25,000/-.
                            The Bishop of Bombay had obtained a grant for the purpose. In 1883 an indenture
                            between the Secretary in State for Council in India and the Rt. Rev. George Milne,
                            Bishop of Bombay, was signed. The grant was received from the Department under the
                            old grant-in-aid Rules for European and Eurasian (Anglo-Indian) Schools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1950 the school was registered as a Public Trust under the Bombay Public Trusts
                            Act and functioned under the Poona Diocesan Schools Committee which was responsible
                            for both the Bishop's School and St. Mary's School. In 1965, the Poona Diocesan
                            Schools Committee resolved that two new societies be formed for separate administration
                            of the two schools. In 1966, the P. D. S. C. accepted resolutions for the dissolution
                            of the P. D. S. C. in favor of two separate societies. In 1967, the St. Mary's School,
                            Poona, and the Bishop's School, Poona, registered as two separate societies, and
                            in 1969 these two separate societies became the legal successors of the Poona Diocesan
                            Schools Committee. Most of our present Trustees are the Trustees approved by the
                            P. D. S. C. in 1967.</p>
                        <p>
                            Bishop's School continues to run as a minority-run Anglo-Indian School. It has always
                            been an Anglo-Indian School. Even the indenture of 1883clearly quotes it to be an
                            Anglo-Indian School. The Bishop's School, Poona, today is among the leading schools
                            of the Nation. There are boys in the school from every state in the country and
                            from all sections of society. In fact we have boys from many lands as well. It is
                            a great tribute to the school that boys from different states, different lands,
                            different faiths live together and it can truly be said to be one of the 'cradles
                            of integration' of the nation.</p>
                        From a school consisting of one Teacher and 15 Bishopites, it has grown to a school
                        of nearly 80 Staff Members (Teaching, Domestic and Office) and nearly 2000 Bishopites
                        (230 of them are boarders). The old boys of the Bishop's School have made a significant
                        contribution in every walk of life, and are a living tribute to the fine training
                        and education imparted in this school. It would not be out of place in this short
                        history to express our deep sense of gratitude to all who in their generation have
                        helped to build up what we inherit, specially to Mr. H. C. Manee Rev. and Mrs. Cooper
                        and Mr. A. E. Lunn who between them were responsible for 75 years of this School's
                        History.
